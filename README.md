# Project-Zakheera-Community-Information-Platform

This project investigates the importance of community knowledge when
navigating cities and exploring the existence and effectiveness
of digital platforms for storing and accessing such information.
A qualitative methodology was employed, involving a comprehensive
literature review and semi-structured interviews with
diverse participants. Thematic analysis of the interview data
revealed several key findings, including the need for better
integration of navigation apps, the provision of practical and
relevant navigation assistance, and the incorporation of up-to-date
and community-driven information.
