## ✨ Project overview
Navigating cities relies heavily on **local, community-based knowledge** — insights that traditional navigation tools often fail to capture.  
This project investigates:

- How people access community knowledge when navigating cities
- Limitations of existing navigation platforms (e.g., Google Maps)
- Opportunities for **community-driven digital navigation systems**

The project combines **qualitative research** with **human-centered design**, culminating in a high-fidelity prototype for a community-powered navigation platform.

## 🎯 Research goals
- Understand how individuals rely on community knowledge for navigation
- Identify gaps in existing digital navigation tools
- Explore how community-generated data can improve:
  - Accuracy
  - Safety
  - Cultural relevance
  - Trust
- Design a conceptual digital platform that integrates these insights

---

## 🧾 Data & research sources
This study is based on **qualitative data**, not transactional datasets.

### Primary data
- Semi-structured interviews with diverse participants
- Lived experiences navigating Pakistani cities

### Secondary data
- Comprehensive literature review on:
  - Community-generated maps
  - Civic tech
  - Smart cities
  - Public participation
  - Community knowledge in South Asia & Africa

---

## 🧠 Methodology
**Research approach:**
- Qualitative, exploratory
- Human-centered computing perspective

**Methods used:**
- Literature review
- Semi-structured interviews
- Thematic analysis

**Artifacts produced:**
- Interview transcripts
- Thematic codebook
- Insight synthesis
- UX flows & Hi-Fi screens

---

## 🧹 Thematic analysis
Interview data was analyzed using **thematic analysis**, resulting in structured themes such as:

- Tech modes of accessing community information
- Trust in local vs commercial recommendations
- Outdated and missing data in navigation tools
- Safety and practicality of suggested routes
- Challenges with unstructured community platforms

A detailed **codebook** documents:
- Themes
- Sub-themes
- Definitions
- Supporting evidence

---

## 🧭 Key findings
- **Community knowledge is critical** for accurate and safe navigation
- Users trust **locals more than platforms or influencers**
- Existing navigation tools:
  - Miss local landmarks
  - Ignore temporary events (festivals, road closures)
  - Suggest unsafe or impractical routes
- Community knowledge exists, but is:
  - Fragmented
  - Unstructured
  - Poorly integrated into navigation apps

> *“The best recommendations come from locals, but finding them online is hard.”*

---

## 🎨 Design outcome — Community-driven navigation platform
Based on research insights, a **high-fidelity mobile app prototype** was designed to:

- Integrate navigation with community-generated ratings & stories
- Allow users to:
  - Explore cities by themes (culture, food, history, safety)
  - Read verified community reviews
  - Contribute stories, photos, and insights
- Segment ratings by:
  - Gender
  - Age groups
  - Safety & accessibility considerations

### Key design features
- City & interest-based onboarding
- Community-moderated reviews
- Safety-aware navigation
- Cultural storytelling layered onto maps
- Local events & temporary updates

---

## 📊 Design & research artifacts
- 📄 **Final Research Report** (PDF)
- 🧾 **Thematic Analysis Codebook**
- 🎨 **Hi-Fi UX Design Screens**
- 🧠 Research-backed user flows

---

## 🧩 Challenges addressed
- Synthesizing unstructured qualitative data
- Translating research insights into concrete design decisions
- Designing for **trust, safety, and inclusivity**
- Balancing openness with moderation in community platforms

---

## 🤖 AI disclosure
AI tools were used to:
- Assist with thematic coding organization
- Help refine academic writing
- Support UX ideation and iteration
- Debug documentation and formatting

All research insights, interpretations, and design decisions were human-led.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **community knowledge**, when thoughtfully structured and ethically integrated into digital platforms, can significantly improve urban navigation — particularly in contexts where formal systems are incomplete or outdated.

By combining qualitative research with human-centered design, the project highlights a pathway toward more **inclusive, culturally aware, and safer navigation experiences**.
